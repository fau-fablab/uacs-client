# uacs-client
client software for the universal access control system

This is the client for a ucas. It can communicate with the ucas-server by reading JSON Objects presented via html.

DEPRECATED: check for a hardcoded fauids permissions
DONE: change the fauid we work with from being hardcoded to being read by a cardreader
DONE: blink a led should the user have sufficient permissions

TODO: Do some testing. Were ready for Alpha 0.1 :-)
